# NewPirateTimes

Swift sample coding project 

The specifications for this coding challenge was to simply create an app that consumed articles from the NY Times.  There were no other requirements so I had to creatively come up with an original idea. 

The project depends on a few cocoapod repositories:

* Alamofire
* SwiftyJson
* Kingfisher

After cloning the project to your desktop, run the "pod install" command.  This will create a "PirateTimes.xcworkspace" file 
which you can then open and build the project.

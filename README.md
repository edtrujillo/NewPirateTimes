# NewPirateTimes

Swift sample coding project 
Fetch articles from the NY Times and convert them to Pirate/Pig-Latin

The project depends on a few cocoapod repositories:

* Alamofire
* SwiftyJson
* Kingfisher

After cloning the project to your desktop, run the "pod install" command.  This will create a "PirateTimes.xcworkspace" file 
which you can then open and build the project.
